We implemented:
-In the client (Pedro):
	-The parse of the arguments	
	-The Library that contacts the Tm
		-Transactions 
		-Wait
		(we have the status function but it does not do anything  yet)
	

-In the Tm (Pedro and Beatriz):
	-The parse of the arguments
	- Receiving requests from various clients concurrently and treating them one by one (can be "out of order" if they not intersect)
		- Requests are marked with Yes,Maybe,No
			- Yes, they can be executed right now or are waiting for their requested lease
			- Maybe, they are waiting for someone to end to see if they can use it's lease 
				(right now we cant have a Maybe then a Yes, but we can optimize the code to have Maybe then a Yes if the second one does not intersect the first)
			- No, they have not been verified yet or they are with No behind a Maybe 
				(optimization of this possible, with the one above)
	- Receiving leases from lm
		- Eliminating residual leases that could block the new leases (and broadcast that removal of leases)
			(residual lease is a lease that will not be used again but it would not be removed by normal means)
			(normal means for us is by being removed after ending a transaction and the lease was marked to end)
			(a lease marked to end is a lease that intersects any other lease after itself)
	- Receiving propagation broadcasts from other tms
	(not yet implemented suspections or crashes)

-In the Lm (Beatriz and Pedro):
	-The parse of the arguments
	- We implemented paxos 
		(without the timeslot, a new epoch is started after the one before ended)
	(not yet implemented multi-paxos)

-In the parser to start all of the nodes (Clients,Tms and Lms) (Carlos):
	-We implemented all of it

We couldn't test the project yet with real running tests, for time reasons, 
but we tested with a lot of Tests (some of them are in comments in the code to help visualize the problem) 
created by us to try and break our solution

There is a bug in the VS that sometimes when you download the solution from the github it stays stuck compiling, please restart the VS if that happens
